## Welcome to Book My Event üåü
Book My Event is a modern web application designed to streamline event management for organizers, attendees, and staff. Built with a robust tech stack combining Spring Boot and React, it offers a seamless and secure platform for creating, purchasing, and validating tickets.

### Overview
Book My Event empowers organizers to set up and manage events, enables attendees to buy and manage tickets, and equips staff with tools to validate entries using QR codes. This intermediate-level project showcases full-stack development, focusing on secure authentication, real-time inventory management, and a comprehensive event lifecycle management system.

### Features üéâ
- **Event Creation**: Create events with customizable details such as name, date, venue, and multiple ticket types with varying prices.
- **Ticket Purchase**: Facilitate a user-friendly search and selection process with secure payment processing and real-time inventory management to prevent overselling.
- **Sales Management**: Provide an interactive dashboard for tracking sales metrics, purchaser details, and automated sales controls based on quantity and date rules.
- **Ticket Validation**: Enable instant QR code scanning at entry, prevent duplicate ticket use, and offer a manual fallback system.
- **Authentication**: Ensure secure user access with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Maintain data integrity to avoid duplicate events or invalid ticket configurations.

     - Packaging: Jar
     - Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Validation, Lombok
   - Download the generated ZIP, extract it to your workspace, and open in your IDE.
   - Configure `src/main/resources/application.properties` with:
     ```
     spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://localhost:9090/realms/book-my-event
     ```
   - Run the backend:
     ```
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
3. **Frontend Setup**
   - Download the React frontend source code from the project's Discord channel.
   - Extract the ZIP to a `frontend` directory in your project root.
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
